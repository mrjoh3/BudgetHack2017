# BudgetHack2017

## The Pitch

I’m Gladys, and I have a brother in politics and government. I’m lucky I can ask him why things are the way they are, and tell him what I think they should be instead. Now, what if you, me, and every other Victorian could have that kind of relationship with the state budget?

Introducing iTreasurer. Unlike other budget games on the market, iTreasurer doesn’t just teach people about the budget, it allows them to have their say in the next one! And who doesn’t love to give their opinion?

Behind me is the iTreasurer interface. Each tile corresponds to an area. For example, if you click on education, it’ll display previous years’ spending and outcomes, such as NAPLAN test results. If you want to learn more, there are links on the side.

You then manipulate the tiles to choose what areas you’d like to prioritise spending on. You can see how your prioritisation of a particular area compares to the current Budget, in the “Your Priorities section”. Once you’ve ranked everything, you can see what Victoria would look like if the Budget was to be spent your way, in the “Your Victoria” section.

Once you’ve submitted your preferences, you can see what Victoria would look like based on all submitted preferences, in the “Our Victoria” page.  The government can then use all the data collected by iTreasurer, to inform future budgts.

What you see today is the result of just 5 days of work by our team of five. This interface is relatively simple to implement, but the real challenge lies in encouraging uptake by government and the general public.

There are 5 values that the Victorian government expects Victorians to live by. The fifth and final value is, in inverted commas “It is up to all of us to contribute to a Victoria we can be proud of”. Through iTreasurer, we can do exactly that. Join me, and the iTreasurer team, in contributing to a Victorian state budget we can be proud of. Thank you.
